Sales data analysed through Tableau Dashboard

In the following project, I have analysed the data of a hardware seller based on the provided data from years 2017 - 2020. Following the huge fall in sales numbers in 2020,
I have attempted to trace the sales trend, and find the root cause behind the loss. SQL Database comprises of more than 140,000 records with everything summarised within one dashboard.

On thorough analysis, it has been found that the most profit yielding location for company in 2019 turned out to be the worst calamity for them in 2020. Once yielding
a profit of more than 8% in 2019, Lucknow has since contributed only to the loss of organization in 2020 with overall 2% loss in 2020.
